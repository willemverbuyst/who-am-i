# Introduction page

## What is this?

This is a revision of the page I made to introduce myself to class 40 of Codaisseur.

## Why?

I decided to rebuild this page, to add and/or review techniques we have learned.
Besides I wanted to practice a good Git work flow.

## Initial goal

Use HTML and CSS only.
Create a parallax.
